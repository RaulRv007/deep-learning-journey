# 🌱 Week 1 - May 5, 2025

This is my first week in this project of learning this new world of deep learning. I am starting from the really basics. I already know the basic Python concepts and some OpenCV image processing concepts. I've done before some other projects related to deep learning such as face detection using `haar_cascades`, face recognition in real time using the library `face_recognition`, as well as some other projects related to hand tracking using the Google library MediaPipe.

But I felt if I really wanted to create something unique and new, I needed to learn deep learning from the basics, and from there apply that knowledge to whatever area I want — for example, robotics 🤖 or AI applications 🧠.  
I think I am gonna keep these weekly updates in this repository to be able to track my own process, and if at the same time I can help someone else, that would be perfect ✨.

## ✅ Completed  
This week I've started the course so I've done a lot of progress:

- 📘 **Search** Lecture in the CS50’s *Introduction to AI with Python* course  
- 🔍 Project: *Degrees of Kevin Bacon* (Stack and Queue Frontier)  
- 🎲 Project: *Rubik’s Cube Solver* (really simple, only 2x2x2 and using Stack and Queue Frontiers — it cannot solve the cube if the number of required movements is more than 3)  
- ❌⭕ Project: *Tic-Tac-Toe* (Minimax)  
- 📘 **Knowledge**  
- 🧩 Project: *Knights and Knaves* (Propositional Logic)  
- 💣 Project: *Minesweeper Player* (Inference)  
- 📘 **Uncertainty**

## 🧠 Key Concepts Learned  
- How nodes work (a concept I've been struggling with for a while)  
- Understanding of a frontier  
- Different ways to process a frontier (Stack and Queue)  
- Heuristic function  
- Minimax (for 1v1 games)  
- Alpha-Beta Pruning  
- Knowledge-based agents  
- Propositional logic  
- Inference from previous knowledge  
- Knowledge engineering  
- Inference rules  
- CNF → *Conjunctive Normal Form*  
- Inference by resolution: To determine if KB entails α, assume that (KB and NOT(α)) and keep checking. If while checking there is an empty clause, that means KB does entail α  
- First-order logic  
- Universal Quantification  
- Existential Quantification  
- World scenarios are not binary  
- Probability theory  
- Random variables 🎲

## 💭 Thoughts  
- I feel that I really needed to start from the basics. Everything that I am learning is completely new  
- *Search* was really interesting, it was a new approach on how to visualize problems and confront them  
- The heuristic concept is a concept I hadn't heard about before but is really interesting and solves a lot of problems. Finding the correct heuristic for a problem can be the most important step to design the AI model/algorithm  
- When trying to do the *Search* projects I was really lost because I did not know what was the idea of the projects  
- I found the *Degrees of Kevin Bacon* one really interesting and really fun (I love cinema 📽️🎬). I got it working with the small database, but it was taking too long to solve the large DB. I tried both Stack and Queue frontiers, and both did not work — sometimes even with close actors such as Zendaya and Tom Holland. So I honestly don't know how I feel about that project  
- Then I did the *Knowledge* lecture which I found really interesting. I already knew some concepts from my logic doors lectures, but in general, everything was new and again another way to solve problems  
- After doing that, I did the *Knights and Knaves* project. That one was quite straightforward, sometimes just the necessity to find the logic  
- Doing the *Tic-Tac-Toe* was awful. I think I was not understanding completely how the minimax worked and even less how to apply it to the code. My main problem was the recursion (it is not really recursion) of the algorithm — that was giving me trouble. At the end, I almost had it, but I needed to use ChatGPT to get it working completely. I think I now understand it, but I wanna do another project that uses this algorithm. At the same time, I think it is really fun to do a project like this. I'm thinking of doing either a *Connect 4* or *Checkers* — still thinking  
- Doing the *Minesweeper* project was not bad. It took me 3 read-throughs of the exercise to fully understand it, but when I got it, I did it and I was really happy with the result. And I am pretty sure it works perfectly as it should. When I got it completely alone, I was really really happy 😄  
- The last thing I've done is the *Uncertainty* lesson. I feel this is a more realistic approach on how AI works. Still a bit confused — a lot of new concepts. I think after doing the projects, I will be able to understand how these concepts actually apply to the real world  
- One thing I've noticed is that all those probabilities used in these problems will eventually be obtained from a neural network through the training process, using other algorithms such as backpropagation 🧮

## 🔜 Next Steps  
- Start working on the *PageRank* project, first project of the *Uncertainty* lesson  
- Finish the second project of the *Uncertainty* lesson  
- Take the *Optimization* lesson
