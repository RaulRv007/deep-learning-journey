# 🌱 Week 2 - May 12, 2025

This week wasn’t as productive as the first one. I had a busy weekend and couldn’t dedicate as much time as I wanted to this project. Still, I made some progress, and I want to keep documenting everything — even the slower weeks count in the long run 📉➡️📈.

## ✅ Completed  
- 📘 **Uncertainty Lecture** in the *CS50’s Introduction to AI with Python* course  
- 📊 **Project**: PageRank (Sampling method only)

## 🧠 Key Concepts Learned  
- Conditional probability  
- Bayes’ Rule  
- Prior and posterior probabilities  
- Independence and conditional independence  
- Sampling vs. Iterative estimation  
- How randomness and probability fit into decision-making  
- How ranking can be calculated without direct "knowledge" — just behavior modeling

## 💭 Thoughts  
This week I tackled the *Uncertainty* lesson. It introduced a more realistic approach to AI — everything is not always known, and working with probabilities becomes crucial. It’s a lot to process, and I still feel confused about some of the concepts, but I think the project will help reinforce them.  

I started the **PageRank project** and implemented the sampling method. It was interesting to see how you can simulate behavior over time to estimate something as complex as web page importance. The logic made sense after re-reading it a couple of times, but I didn’t get to the iterative part — which I hope to tackle next week.

In general, this week felt slower, but that’s okay. I know that sometimes progress is not linear. Even when you don’t feel like you’re moving forward, you’re still laying down groundwork 🧱.

## 🔜 Next Steps  
- Complete the **Iterative part** of the PageRank project  
- Take the **Optimization lecture**  
- Revisit **sampling vs. iteration** to solidify understanding  
- Try to relate these concepts to real-world systems like search engines or ranking in games
