# 🌿 Week 3 - May 19, 2025

This week felt much better — like I was back in the rhythm of learning. I finally wrapped up the second half of the PageRank project and moved on to the next big topic: Optimization. While I didn’t build a project for this lesson yet, I feel like I’m absorbing some of the foundational tools that will be useful later. Progress isn’t always fast, but it *is* happening 🚶‍♂️➡️🏃‍♂️.

## ✅ Completed  
- 🔁 **Iterative PageRank algorithm** (completed both parts of the PageRank project)  
- ⚙️ **Optimization Lecture** in the *CS50’s Introduction to AI with Python* course

## 🧠 Key Concepts Learned  
- Iterative convergence for ranking systems  
- Damping factor and the importance of probability flow  
- Hill-climbing as a local search strategy  
- Backtracking for constraint satisfaction problems  
- Linear programming as a powerful tool for optimization  
- How heuristics and constraints shape feasible solutions

## 💭 Thoughts  
Finishing the iterative PageRank code felt satisfying. It took me a while to figure out the structure, but once the loop and convergence logic clicked, it became very methodical. It was also interesting to compare the iterative and sampling results — I noticed that the iterative version gave more stable values with higher precision.

The **Optimization** lecture was a whirlwind. So many new strategies packed into a single lesson — backtracking, hill-climbing, linear programming. I can already see how useful these tools will be, especially when AI needs to *build* or *solve* things under constraints.  

While I haven’t started the **Crossword project** yet, I’m feeling more confident and ready to dive into it. This week helped recharge my momentum 💪.

## 🔜 Next Steps  
- Build the **Crossword project** for Optimization  
- Practice more with **backtracking and constraint logic**  
- Explore how optimization is used in real-world applications (scheduling, layout design, resource planning)  
- Keep refining my understanding of ranking and probabilistic models
